title: Leap Year of the Monkey
---

At some point in the last decade, I semi-consciously started to fork away from mainstream development and into the nichey/enterprisey ESRI Utility GIS space. This has been a world largely frozen in time, mostly immune to the prevailing technical winds of the 21st century. 

For process, the last project took a bet on Waterfall project methodology. A list of some of the technologies in play; COM(!), Oracle PL/SQL, .NET of the Winforms variety, file & data-level integration and, most perplexingly, Silverlight...

Browsing hacker news has just left me with a headspinning "all the things" feeling. But with my current project winding down, it's time to take a series of leaps forward into whatever is current. Of course, I'm not exactly sure how this works with the fragmentation. There is no roadmap but a few things:
- pursue open-source geospatial tech. ESRI has been, and continues to be, a great platform. Sure, it's large and hairy but the company is dedicated to innovation and making things work. But it would be crazy not to gain a deeper understanding of the alternatives, and hopefully see what's better/worse
- find something(s) concrete to get stuck into. The only way to learn something is by implementing it. These may be proofs-of-concept or something bigger. 
- if not publicize, at least blog/publish thoughts/ideas/code
